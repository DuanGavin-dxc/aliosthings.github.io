# AliOS Things Certification

The AliOS Things Certification services microcontroller (MCU) vendors who want to certificate their MCU-based hardware on AliOS Things. The goal of the AliOS Things is to ensure that developers can run AliOS Things on their choice of MCU-based hardware stably. In order to provide a consistent development experience for developers, the AliOS Things Certification develops a series of security, functionality, stability, and performance requirements that all microcontrollers must meet (according to actual hardware conditions).
