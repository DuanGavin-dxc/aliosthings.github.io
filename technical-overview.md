## Kernel

### Rhino RTOS Kernel

---

Rhino is in-house designed and developed by AliOS Things team. It is characterized by ultra-small footprint, low power consumption, real time, multitasking, and debug features.

Rhino provides rich kernel primitives including buffer queue, ring buffer, timer, semaphore, mutex, fifo, event, etc.

#### Small footprint

Rhino provides both static and dynamic allocation for most of the kernel objects. A memory allocator designed for small memory block management can support both fixed block and variable block. It can also support multiple memory region.

Most of the kernel features such as work queue and memory allocator could be scalable and configurable by modifying the file named k_config.h.

With the ability to scale component in and out, Rhino could make the final image as small as possible, which could be programmed into device with very small flash size.

#### Low power consumption

For the IoT devices, itâ€™s important to consider the power consumption for hardware because the battery capacity is limited. The faster the system consumes the power, the shorter its live time will be. Rhino kernel provides tickless idle mode for CPU to help system save the power and extend its battery life.

Normally, when CPU has nothing to do, it will execute a native instruction of the processor (WFI for ARM, HLT for IA32-bit processors) to enter a low power state, when the CPU register context is maintained, and system tick clock interrupts wakes up the CPU at every tick moment.

To save more power than normal, Rhino kernel provides tickless idle mode for CPU. When OS detects there is nothing to do in feature within a fixed duration (multiple ticks or longer), it is called tickless idle time. At that time, the system tick clock is programmed to fire interrupt and put CPU into C1 state(CPU execute a native instruction, WFI for ARM, HLT for IA 32-bit processors). From then on, there won't be system tick clock interrupt any more. The system tick count will stop increasing and CPU maintain low power mode(C1) until tickless idle time passes, when the system tick timer interrupt is fired again to wake up CPU from C1 to C0 state, and passed ticks is compensated to system tick count.

#### Real time

Rhino provides two scheduling policies, priority-based/preemptive scheduling and round-robin scheduling. For both scheduling policies, the highest priority task is always preferred for scheduling.

A priority-based preemptive scheduler preempts the CPU when a task has a higher priority than the current task running. This means that if a task with a higher priority than that of the current task becomes ready to run, the kernel will immediately save the current task's context, and switch to the context of the higher priority task. Thus, the kernel ensures that the CPU is always allocated to the highest priority task that is ready to run. 

A round-robin scheduler shares the CPU amongst these tasks by using time-slicing. Each task in a group of tasks with the same priority is arranged to execute for a defined interval, or time slice, before relinquishing the CPU to the next task in the group. None of them, therefore, can usurp the processor until it is blocked. When the time slice expires, the task moves to the last one in the ready queue list for that priority.

#### Debug features

Rhino can support stack overflow, memory leak, memory corruption detection which helps developer figure out root cause of difficult issues. Cooperating with AliOS Studio IDE, Rhino's trace function help visualize overall system activities.

### Yloop event framework

---

Yloop is an asynchronous event framework, highly considering [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) and event loop used in Embedded world. Yloop provides a mechanism to handle IO(mainly socket), timer, system events, user events in a single task, which greatly reduces memory usage while avoiding the complexity of multi-threading programming.

Yloop instance is bound to task context. Multiple Yloop instances can also be created, and each is bound to a single task, so that more performance can be achieved in powerful hardware.

### KV

---

Designed for flash especially NOR Flash:

- much less erase times to extend flash life
- power safe, no middle-state status will exist
- key-value friendly usage, value supports binary format data
- minimum supported flash size is 8KB

### Protocol Stack

---

To help device connect to cloud more easily, AliOS Things provide protocol stacks in flexible ways.

For IP oriented devices:

- a well-tested LwIP stack is provided for directly connected SoCs, including WiFi Soc, MCU+SDIO/SPI WiFi Module, etc.
- SAL(Socket Adapter Layer) for MCU attached with serial communication modules such as WiFi/NB/GPRS.
- uMesh for building more complex, mesh networking topology

For non-IP devices:

- LoRaWAN stack is integrated
- BLE standard APIs, and BLE Stack

LoRaWAN and BLE Stack will be integrated in the near future.

### LwIP

AliOS Things maintains a TCP/IP stack based on LwIP v2.0.0, and support IPv4 Only, IPv6 Only, IPv4&IPv6 Coexist. IPv4 and IPv6 are well tested in daily CI, and IPv6 is widely used and tested in uMesh.

### SAL(Socket Adapter Layer)

---

SAL is to provide standard Socket capabilities with serial WiFi/GPRS/NB-IoT modules. Specifically, considering that AT Command is the most popular form in this scenario, a AT Parser is provided to help handling AT.

With SAL, developers can use common Socket APIs to access network, which will reduce the efforts to integrate existing software components.

### uMesh

---

uMesh is a mesh implementation with following features:

- RF standards independent, currently support 802.11/802.15.4/BLE, and more can be supported
- Routing mesh, support Tree Topology, Mesh Topology and Layered Tree&Mesh Topology

### uData

---

uData is a specific software framework for IoT smart services based on a series of sensors, and has a general name of Sensor Hub traditionally. 

There are two parts in the uData Framework. One is in the framework layer including uData service manager, service algo, abstact model(abs), and the other is in the kernel layer providing the sensor driver SDK. 

The target scope of uData service will focus on the IoT business like drone toy, smart street lamp, sweeper robot and so on. The sensor drivers will not only provide the sensor SDK, but also sensor drivers like ALS, Barometer,temperature, accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer, etc.

### IoT Protocols

---

AliOS Things supports rich cloud connection protocols:

- Alink: Alibaba Cloud Link platform, suitable for Smart Life. WiFi Provisioning component YWSS is also included.
- MQTT: standard MQTT protocol, combining with Alibaba Cloud IoT Suite.
